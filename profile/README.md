## Synopsys

This research project seeks to repurpose the ScorBot ER-4, an educational robotic arm, into an autonomous robotic cameraperson. While basic videography techniques are well understood, capturing high-quality footage in dynamic environments like classrooms or live presentations requires constant operator attention. The project's goal is to automate camera operations—such as panning, tilting, zooming, and framing subjects—to create more engaging recordings.
This project includes the ideation, research, and development of software that integrates machine learning, computer vision, and other technologies to guide camera movements. Secondary objectives include multi-cameras for A and B-Roll, multi-subject tracking, and live or post-processed video footage. The system’s scope and features will evolve as the capabilities of the software and hardware become clearer.
A core goal of the project is to extend the life of outdated technology by combining modern cameras with older robotics arms for new applications.
